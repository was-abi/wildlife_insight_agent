# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Wildlife Insight Agent is a Python-based application that leverages the CrewAI framework and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create an automated pipeline for researching, analyzing, and reporting on wildlife species and climate data. The system will use MCP tools to fetch data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API for species information and climate APIs for environmental data, then generate beginner-friendly reports about wildlife conservation status, distribution patterns, and climate correlations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student or conservationist, I want to automatically fetch wildlife species data using an MCP tool, so that I can access current scientific information through a standardized protocol interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL register an MCP tool called "fetch_species"
2. WHEN the fetch_species tool is called with a species_name parameter THEN it SHALL query the GBIF API at https://api.gbif.org/v1/species/search?q={species_name}
3. WHEN the API responds THEN the tool SHALL return the complete JSON response
4. IF the API request fails THEN the tool SHALL handle the error gracefully and return meaningful error information
5. WHEN the Research Agent executes THEN it SHALL call the fetch_species MCP tool with input "tiger"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to automatically fetch climate data using an MCP tool, so that I can correlate environmental conditions with species distribution patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL register an MCP tool called "fetch_climate_data"
2. WHEN the fetch_climate_data tool is called with a location parameter THEN it SHALL query the Open Meteo API for weather/climate data
3. WHEN the API responds THEN the tool SHALL return JSON with temperature and climate information
4. IF the API request fails THEN the tool SHALL handle the error gracefully and return meaningful error information
5. WHEN the Research Agent executes THEN it SHALL call the fetch_climate_data MCP tool with input "New York"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically analyze both species and climate data, so that I can identify key conservation insights and environmental correlations without manual data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN species and climate data are received from the research phase THEN the system SHALL analyze occurrence counts and temperature patterns
2. WHEN analyzing the data THEN the system SHALL extract endangered status information and climate trends
3. WHEN processing combined information THEN the system SHALL identify correlations between species distribution and environmental conditions
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL pass structured insights to the reporting phase

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a beginner in wildlife conservation, I want to receive a simple, human-readable report about species and climate data, so that I can understand complex biodiversity and environmental information without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis insights are received THEN the system SHALL generate a beginner-friendly summary report
2. WHEN creating the report THEN the system SHALL use simple, non-technical language
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include key findings about species conservation status and climate correlations
4. WHEN the report is complete THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, readable format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use a multi-agent architecture with CrewAI and MCP tools, so that I can leverage specialized AI agents and standardized tool protocols for different aspects of the wildlife research pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create three distinct agents: Research Agent, Analysis Agent, and Report Agent
2. WHEN agents are created THEN each SHALL have a specific role, goal, and backstory as defined in the specifications
3. WHEN the Research Agent executes THEN it SHALL use MCP tools to fetch both species and climate data
4. WHEN tasks are executed THEN each agent SHALL perform its designated function in sequence with four total tasks
5. WHEN one task completes THEN its results SHALL be passed as context to the next task

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP tools to be organized in a modular structure, so that they can be easily maintained and potentially reused in other projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL include a tools/ directory containing MCP tool implementations
2. WHEN MCP tools are implemented THEN they SHALL be in separate files: tools/species_tool.py and tools/climate_tool.py
3. WHEN tools are created THEN each SHALL implement its respective function with proper type hints
4. WHEN tools are registered THEN they SHALL be imported and registered in the main.py file

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily set up and run the wildlife insight agent, so that I can use the system without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is distributed THEN it SHALL include a requirements.txt file with crewai, requests, matplotlib, and mcp dependencies
2. WHEN the project is set up THEN users SHALL be able to install dependencies with a single pip command
3. WHEN the system is executed THEN it SHALL run with a simple "python main.py" command
4. WHEN the project is accessed THEN it SHALL include a clear README.md with setup and usage instructions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow Python best practices and project structure, so that the code is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL follow the standard Python project structure with tools/ directory
2. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL use meaningful variable and function names
3. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL include proper error handling
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be clearly specified in requirements.txt
