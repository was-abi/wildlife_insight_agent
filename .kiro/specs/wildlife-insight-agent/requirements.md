# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Wildlife Insight Agent is a Python-based application that leverages the CrewAI framework to create an automated pipeline for researching, analyzing, and reporting on wildlife species data. The system will use the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API to fetch species information and generate beginner-friendly reports about wildlife conservation status and distribution patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student or conservationist, I want to automatically fetch wildlife species data from a reliable biodiversity database, so that I can access current scientific information without manual research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is executed THEN it SHALL fetch species data from the GBIF API for a specified query (default: "tiger")
2. WHEN the API request is made THEN the system SHALL use the endpoint https://api.gbif.org/v1/species/search?q={query}
3. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL return the complete JSON response
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically analyze species occurrence data, so that I can identify key conservation insights without manual data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN species data is received from the research phase THEN the system SHALL analyze occurrence counts
2. WHEN analyzing the data THEN the system SHALL extract endangered status information
3. WHEN processing species information THEN the system SHALL identify distribution trends
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL pass structured insights to the reporting phase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a beginner in wildlife conservation, I want to receive a simple, human-readable report about species data, so that I can understand complex biodiversity information without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis insights are received THEN the system SHALL generate a beginner-friendly summary report
2. WHEN creating the report THEN the system SHALL use simple, non-technical language
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include key findings about species conservation status
4. WHEN the report is complete THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, readable format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use a multi-agent architecture with CrewAI, so that I can leverage specialized AI agents for different aspects of the wildlife research pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create three distinct agents: Research Agent, Analysis Agent, and Report Agent
2. WHEN agents are created THEN each SHALL have a specific role, goal, and backstory as defined in the specifications
3. WHEN tasks are executed THEN each agent SHALL perform its designated function in sequence
4. WHEN one task completes THEN its results SHALL be passed as context to the next task

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily set up and run the wildlife insight agent, so that I can use the system without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is distributed THEN it SHALL include a requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN the project is set up THEN users SHALL be able to install dependencies with a single pip command
3. WHEN the system is executed THEN it SHALL run with a simple "python main.py" command
4. WHEN the project is accessed THEN it SHALL include a clear README.md with setup and usage instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow Python best practices and project structure, so that the code is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL follow the standard Python project structure
2. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL use meaningful variable and function names
3. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL include proper error handling
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be clearly specified in requirements.txt
