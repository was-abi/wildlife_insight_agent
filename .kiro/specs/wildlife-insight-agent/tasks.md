# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Set up project structure and dependencies
  - Create the main project directory structure
  - Write requirements.txt with crewai, requests, and matplotlib dependencies
  - Create initial README.md with setup and usage instructions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1_

- [ ] 2. Implement GBIF API client functionality
  - Write the fetch_species_data() helper function to call GBIF API
  - Implement proper error handling for API requests and network issues
  - Add JSON response validation and error response handling
  - Write unit tests for the API client function with mocked responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 6.3_

- [ ] 3. Create and configure the Research Agent
  - Define the Research Agent with role, goal, and backstory as specified
  - Create Task 1 that uses the fetch_species_data function with "tiger" query
  - Implement task execution logic to call the API and return JSON response
  - Add error handling for failed API calls within the agent task
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 4. Create and configure the Analysis Agent
  - Define the Analysis Agent with role, goal, and backstory as specified
  - Create Task 2 that receives data from Task 1 as context
  - Implement analysis logic to extract occurrence counts from GBIF data
  - Add functionality to identify endangered status and distribution trends
  - Structure the output to pass insights to the next task
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Create and configure the Report Agent
  - Define the Report Agent with role, goal, and backstory as specified
  - Create Task 3 that receives analysis insights from Task 2 as context
  - Implement report generation logic using simple, beginner-friendly language
  - Format the final report to include key conservation findings
  - Ensure the report is clear and accessible to non-technical users
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement the CrewAI pipeline orchestration
  - Create the main() function to initialize all three agents
  - Set up the three tasks with proper sequencing and context passing
  - Configure the CrewAI Crew with agents and tasks
  - Implement crew execution and result capture
  - Add proper error handling for the entire pipeline
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 6.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement main application entry point
  - Write the main.py file structure with proper imports
  - Add the main execution block to run the crew when script is executed
  - Implement result printing in the specified format
  - Add basic logging or status messages for user feedback
  - Ensure the application can be run with "python main.py"
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 6.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Implement validation for task context data between agents
  - Add fallback responses for cases with incomplete or missing data
  - Ensure graceful degradation when API or agents fail
  - Add meaningful error messages for common failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 6.3_

- [ ] 9. Write unit tests for core functionality
  - Create tests for the fetch_species_data function with mocked API responses
  - Test error handling scenarios for API failures and invalid responses
  - Verify agent task execution with sample data
  - Test the complete pipeline with known input/output pairs
  - _Requirements: 6.3_

- [ ] 10. Finalize documentation and project setup
  - Complete the README.md with detailed setup instructions and example output
  - Verify all dependencies are correctly specified in requirements.txt
  - Add any necessary code comments for clarity and maintenance
  - Test the complete setup process from a fresh environment
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 6.2, 6.4_
