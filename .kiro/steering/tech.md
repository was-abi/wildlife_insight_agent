# Technology Stack

## Build System & Package Management
- To be determined based on project requirements
- Common options: npm/yarn (Node.js), pip (Python), cargo (Rust), go mod (Go)

## Frameworks & Libraries
- Framework selection should align with project goals and team expertise
- Prefer well-maintained, widely-adopted libraries
- Document all major dependencies and their purposes

## Development Tools
- Use consistent code formatting (prettier, black, rustfmt, gofmt)
- Implement linting rules appropriate for the chosen language
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

## Common Commands
Once the project is initialized, document key commands here:

```bash
# Example commands (update based on actual tech stack)
# Install dependencies
# npm install / pip install -r requirements.txt / cargo build

# Run tests
# npm test / pytest / cargo test / go test

# Build/compile
# npm run build / python setup.py build / cargo build --release

# Start development server
# npm run dev / python manage.py runserver / cargo run
```

## Environment Setup
- Document required versions for runtime and tools
- Include setup instructions for new developers
- Specify any required environment variables or configuration files
